INTRODUCTION</span></h1><p class="c15 c10"><span class="c12"></span></p><h2 class="c56 c18" id="h.198yv8dnrdu9"><span class="c2">1.1 Global food insecurity and the need for alternative methods of food production.</span></h2><p class="c21 c18"><span class="c0">Global food insecurity is a pressing issue that has been exacerbated by various factors, including population growth, climate change, and limited natural resources. In recent years, the need for alternative methods of food production has become increasingly apparent in order to mitigate these challenges.</span></p><p class="c21 c18"><span class="c0">According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), approximately 690 million people worldwide suffered from hunger in 2019, representing an increase of 60 million compared to the previous year. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has further worsened the situation, with an estimated additional 132 million people experiencing acute food insecurity in 2020.[1]</span></p><p class="c21 c18"><span class="c0">The conventional methods of food production, which rely heavily on the use of chemicals, fertilizers, and pesticides, have significant negative impacts on the environment, such as soil degradation, water pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions. Adopting alternative methods of food production, therefore, is critical to ensure sustainable food systems while reducing environmental damage.[2]</span></p><p class="c21 c18"><span class="c0">One promising approach is vertical farming, which involves growing crops in vertically stacked layers using artificial lighting and controlled environments. This method can increase crop yields by up to 10 times compared to traditional farming methods, while reducing water usage by up to 90%. Moreover, it can be implemented in urban areas, reducing the distance between the point of production and consumption, thus minimizing the carbon footprint associated with transportation.[3]</span></p><p class="c21 c18"><span class="c0">Another alternative method is aquaponics, which combines aquaculture and hydroponics, allowing for the cultivation of both fish and plants in a closed-loop system. This technique uses only 10% of the water required for traditional farming methods while producing more food per unit area. Furthermore, the waste produced by the fish serves as nutrients for the plants, reducing the need for chemical fertilizers.[4]</span></p><p class="c21 c18"><span class="c0">In addition to these innovative approaches, there is also a growing interest in biofortification, which involves enhancing the nutritional value of crops through breeding or genetic modification. This method could help address malnutrition and related health issues, particularly in developing regions where access to nutritious food is limited.[5]</span></p><p class="c21 c18"><span class="c0">In conclusion, global food insecurity remains a major challenge, and alternative methods of food production are necessary to address the issue. Vertical farming, aquaponics, and biofortification are just a few examples of innovative techniques that can help ensure sustainable, efficient, and nutritious food systems while mitigating environmental damage.</span></p><h2 class="c56 c18" id="h.r7oo3bxyx0jy"><span class="c2">1.2 The popularity of microgreens due to their nutritional benefits, ease of cultivation, and suitability for indoor growing.</span></h2><p class="c21 c18"><span class="c0">Microgreens, the small and vibrant greens that are harvested just a few weeks after planting, have gained immense popularity in recent years due to their numerous health benefits, ease of cultivation, and suitability for indoor growing.[6]</span></p><p class="c21 c18"><span class="c0">According to research by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), microgreens contain up to 40 times more nutrients than their mature counterparts. For example, red cabbage microgreens contain six times more Vitamin C and 69 times more Vitamin K than mature red cabbage. Additionally, they contain high levels of antioxidants, which help fight against inflammation and reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease and cancer.[7]</span></p><p class="c21 c18"><span class="c0">Microgreens are also relatively easy to cultivate, making them an accessible option for home gardeners and urban farmers alike. They can be grown using a variety of methods, including hydroponics, soil, or even on kitchen towels. They require minimal space, water, and sunlight, and can be harvested as early as one to two weeks after planting.[8]</span></p><p class="c21 c18"><span class="c0">Furthermore, microgreens are particularly suitable for indoor growing, making them a viable option for those who live in urban areas with limited access to outdoor space. They can be grown in containers, trays or even vertical gardens, making them a perfect option for small apartment balconies or kitchens. The growing demand for locally sourced and fresh produce has led to the increased popularity of indoor growing, and microgreens are well-suited to this trend.[9]</span></p><p class="c21 c18"><span class="c0">Apart from their numerous health benefits and ease of cultivation, microgreens are also popular due to their versatility in cooking. They can be used in salads, sandwiches, and smoothies, or as a garnish for a variety of dishes.

Problem Statement</span></h1><p class="c10 c15"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c5">The problem addressed in this research paper is the need for an IoT-enabled automation system for microgreen farming using the hydroponic method and a mobile app, in order to improve the efficiency, productivity, and sustainability of microgreen cultivation.</span></p><p class="c7 c18 c10"><span class="c85 c93"></span></p><p class="c21 c18"><span class="c0">The concept of indoor farming has been gaining popularity in recent years, especially with the increased need for sustainable food production due to growing global population and limited arable land. One popular form of indoor farming is microgreen farming, which involves growing edible greens that are harvested just after their first true leaves have emerged. Microgreens have become a popular ingredient in salads, sandwiches, and smoothies due to their high nutritional content and visual appeal.</span></p><p class="c21 c18"><span class="c0">However, microgreen farming can be a labor-intensive process, requiring careful monitoring and control of environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and lighting. The traditional method of soil-based microgreen farming can also lead to issues such as soil-borne diseases, pest infestations, and water wastage.</span></p><p class="c21 c18"><span class="c0">To address these challenges, this research paper proposes the development of an IoT-enabled automation system for microgreen farming using the hydroponic method and a mobile app. Hydroponic farming is a method of growing plants in nutrient-rich water without the use of soil. This method has been shown to be more efficient and environmentally friendly than traditional soil-based farming, with higher yields and lower water usage.</span></p><p class="c21 c18"><span class="c0">The proposed system will consist of a hydroponic setup equipped with sensors to monitor and regulate environmental factors such as pH, temperature, humidity, and light. The data collected by these sensors will be sent to a cloud-based platform using IoT technology, where it will be processed and analyzed. The system will use this data to automatically adjust the environmental conditions in the hydroponic setup to optimize plant growth and health.</span></p><p class="c21 c18"><span class="c0">In addition, the system will be integrated with a mobile app that allows users to remotely monitor and control the hydroponic setup. The app will provide real-time updates on the environmental conditions and plant growth, as well as notifications for when maintenance or adjustments are required. Users will also be able to control the lighting and watering systems through the app, reducing the need for manual intervention.</span></p><p class="c21 c18"><span class="c0">The proposed system has several potential benefits for microgreen farming. By automating the monitoring and control of environmental factors, the system will reduce the need for manual labor and increase the efficiency of the farming process. The hydroponic method will also reduce water usage and minimize the risk of soil-borne diseases and pest infestations. Additionally, the mobile app will provide users with greater flexibility and control over the farming process, allowing them to remotely monitor and adjust the system as needed.</span></p><p class="c21 c18"><span class="c0">Overall, the development of an IoT-enabled automation system for microgreen farming using the hydroponic method and mobile app has the potential to revolutionize the way indoor farming is done. By combining the efficiency and sustainability of hydroponics with the convenience and control of IoT technology, this system has the potential to significantly increase the productivity and profitability of microgreen farming.</span></p><p class="c40 c18 c10"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c40 c18 c10"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c40 c18 c10"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c40 c18 c10"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c40 c18 c10"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c40 c18 c10"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c40 c18 c10"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c40 c18 c10"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c40 c18 c10"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c40 c18 c10"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c40 c18 c10"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c40 c18 c10"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c40 c18 c10"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c40 c18 c10"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c40 c18 c10"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c18 c10 c40"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c40 c18 c10"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c40 c18 c10"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c40 c18 c10"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c40 c18 c10"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c40 c18 c10"><span class="c0"></span></p><h1 class="c74 c18 c65" id="h.5hwfw2wic7l0"><span class="c94 c93">4.

Proposed Methodology</span></h1><p class="c23 c18 c10"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c27 c18"><span class="c0">The advent of technology has brought about significant improvements in various sectors, including agriculture. One such innovation is the smart system designed to monitor and control agriculture in a closed environment that doesn&#39;t get natural sunlight, like a farming box. This technology is an excellent solution to modern-day challenges facing farmers such as unpredictable weather patterns, pests, and diseases that threaten crop yields. &ldquo;The system comprises sensors, controls, a microcontroller, and a wi-fi module to connect to a cloud-based information system&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c27 c18"><span class="c0">The system&#39;s primary goal is to automate the collection of data and adjust the environment for planting based on that data. The collected data is then stored in a database on a cloud-based system, and users can access it through a website for further analysis. The technology also helps farmers manage their crops more efficiently by reducing manual labor and eliminating the need for human intervention. This automation saves farmers a considerable amount of time and money, allowing them to focus on other essential tasks.</span></p><p class="c18 c27"><span class="c0">The system collects data on various environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, and moisture levels, among others. These parameters are critical for crop growth and are constantly monitored and controlled by the system. The collected data is primarily used for research and future system improvements, but it can also be used to make manual adjustments if needed. For example, if the temperature in the box is too high, the system will automatically adjust the cooling system to maintain the optimum temperature for crop growth.</span></p><p class="c27 c18"><span class="c0">The farming box&#39;s design is critical to its functionality. The box is designed to reduce the amount of light that enters it, creating a dark and enclosed environment. Instead of relying on sunlight, a grow light is installed at the top to provide the primary source of light. This ensures that crops receive the necessary light to grow and develop even in areas with limited sunlight.</span></p><p class="c27 c18 c10"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c27 c18 c10"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c27 c18 c10"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c27 c18"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 650.00px; height: 285.16px;"><img alt="" src="images/image28.png" style="width: 650.00px; height: 285.16px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c80 c18"><span class="c12">Fig. 1. Data Flow Diagram </span></p><p class="c24 c18"><span class="c0">Humidity and airflow are essential environmental parameters that need to be monitored and regulated to ensure optimal crop growth. To regulate the humidity and airflow, a fan is installed on the side of the box, which can be adjusted as needed. This ensures that crops receive the necessary airflow to prevent the buildup of moisture that may lead to mold or mildew growth.</span></p><p class="c24 c18"><span class="c0">The box&#39;s bottom holds water, and a water pump is used to manage the amount of water in the growing media. Plants are placed in a tray with planting media and put inside the box. Sensors are installed to monitor and control the humidity, temperature, and moisture levels in the system, which are connected to different actuators. These sensors help ensure that crops receive the necessary nutrients and moisture to grow optimally.</span></p><p class="c24 c18"><span class="c0">In conclusion, the smart system designed to monitor and control agriculture in a closed environment is a significant innovation in the agricultural sector. It is a valuable solution to the challenges facing modern-day farmers, and it helps them manage their crops more efficiently. The system&#39;s design and functionality ensure optimal crop growth, and the automation of data collection and adjustments saves farmers time and money. With the continued advancement of technology, we can expect even more innovative solutions to the challenges facing the agricultural sector.</span></p><p class="c24 c18 c10"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c24 c18"><span class="c0">The development of hardware includes the development of:</span></p><h2 class="c79 c18 c65" id="h.saedzga5fe09"><span class="c2">&nbsp;6.1 Microcontroller Box: </span></h2><p class="c15 c10"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c24 c18"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 325.97px; height: 352.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image8.jpg" style="width: 325.97px; height: 352.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 324.00px; height: 351.75px;"><img alt="" src="images/image26.jpg" style="width: 324.00px; height: 351.75px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c24 c18"><span class="c12">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fig. 2. &nbsp; Microcontroller connection with sensors &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c24 c18 c10"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c24 c18"><span class="c0">The project aims to create an IoT system that can efficiently grow plants by monitoring and controlling various environmental factors inside a container.

This allows the user to keep track of the growth of the plants and the water level, ensuring that they are healthy and well-nourished.</span></p><p class="c24 c18 c10"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c24 c18"><span class="c0">The temperature and humidity levels inside the container are also monitored using a &ldquo;DHT-11 sensor&rdquo;. The sensor records data five times a day, and the information is fed back to the microcontroller. If the temperature inside the container rises too high, the system automatically activates a fan to cool down the environment. </span></p><p class="c24 c18"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 323.97px; height: 430.40px;"><img alt="" src="images/image32.jpg" style="width: 323.97px; height: 430.40px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 326.51px; height: 433.75px;"><img alt="" src="images/image4.jpg" style="width: 326.51px; height: 433.75px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c24 c18"><span class="c12">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Fig. 3. &nbsp; Microcontroller connection with sensors &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c24 c18 c10"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c24 c18"><span class="c0">Simultaneously, the light will turn off to prevent the temperature from rising further.

In the context of IoT applications, the architecture of the system can be divided into &ldquo;three layers - the sensor layer, transport layer, and application layer&rdquo;. This &ldquo;three-layered structure is particularly suitable for surveillance and control systems, and the system architecture&rdquo; is developed based on this model. Essentially, the approach involves breaking down the system into distinct layers that work together to achieve the intended functionality.</span></p><p class="c24 c18 c10"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c24 c18"><span class="c0">The proposed system is designed to monitor the growth of microgreens in an indoor vertical farm.

Mobile UI Design</span></h2><p class="c24 c18"><span class="c0">The goal of this project is to develop a mobile application using Flutter to improve the tracking and management of employee work hours. Flutter is a software development kit (SDK) that allows for the creation of mobile applications for both iOS and Android using a single codebase. This means that developers only need to write one set of code, and Flutter will automatically translate it to both iOS and Android formats. Flutter uses a reactive programming model that allows for fast development and hot reloads, enabling developers to see their changes almost immediately. The framework also includes a range of customizable widgets and user interface (UI) elements that make it easy to create engaging and visually appealing applications. Flutter also has a growing community of developers who contribute to the development of open-source packages, making it easier for developers to add functionality to their applications.</span></p><p class="c24 c18 c10"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c24 c18"><span class="c0">For this project, the mobile application will be used to track employee work hours using geolocation data. The application will allow employees to clock in and out of work by scanning a QR code. The geolocation data will ensure that employees are only able to clock in and out when they are physically present at the work location. The application will also have a feature for employees to request time off, which will be sent to their manager for approval. The application will be developed using Flutter&#39;s widget tree architecture, which is a hierarchical structure of widgets that make up the application&#39;s UI. The architecture allows for a modular approach to development, making it easy to add, remove, or modify individual widgets without affecting the overall functionality of the application.</span></p><p class="c24 c18 c10"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c24 c18"><span class="c0">Flutter also includes a range of plugins and packages that can be easily integrated into the application to add functionality, such as the geolocation and QR code scanning features mentioned above. These packages are developed and maintained by the Flutter community, making it easier for developers to add features to their applications without having to write code from scratch. In addition to its development features, Flutter also prioritizes app performance, resulting in faster load times and smoother animations. The framework achieves this by using the Dart programming language, which compiles into native machine code for both iOS and Android devices. This results in faster execution times and better performance compared to other cross-platform frameworks that use interpreted languages.</span></p><p class="c24 c18 c10"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c24 c18"><span class="c0">Overall, Flutter is a powerful and flexible tool for mobile application development that allows for fast development times, hot reloads, and easy integration of third-party packages. Its widget tree architecture, community-driven packages, and focus on performance make it an excellent choice for building high-quality mobile applications.[*]</span></p><p class="c27 c18 c10"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c27 c18 c10"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c24 c18 c10"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c24 c18 c10"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c24 c18 c10"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c24 c18 c10"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c24 c18 c10"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c24 c18 c10"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c24 c18 c10"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c24 c18 c10"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c24 c18 c10"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c24 c18 c10"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c24 c18 c10"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c24 c18 c10"><span class="c12"></span></p><h1 class="c18 c65 c91" id="h.bc0qdu3y55xa"><span class="c59 c17 c25">7.

It works on the principle of heating a sensing element made of tin oxide, which changes its resistance in the presence of the target gas. The change in resistance is then measured and converted into a voltage signal, which is proportional to the gas concentration in the environment.</span></p><p class="c9 c10"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">In the above project, the &ldquo;MQ5 sensor&rdquo; has been used to detect the concentration of carbon dioxide and methane gasses inside the indoor vertical farm.

If the concentration of these gasses exceeds a certain threshold, it can be harmful to the plants and affect their growth.</span></p><p class="c9 c10"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">To prevent this, the &ldquo;MQ5 sensor&rdquo; is used to continuously monitor the concentration of carbon dioxide and methane inside the farm. When the concentration exceeds the threshold value, the system triggers an exhaust fan to turn on, which ventilates the farm and removes the harmful gasses. The exhaust fan remains on until the concentration of the gasses falls below the threshold value.</span></p><p class="c9 c10"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Using the &ldquo;MQ5 sensor&rdquo; for gas detection is a cost-effective and reliable method, as it can detect a wide range of gasses and has a fast response time.

In the above project, it has been used in conjunction with other environmental control systems to create a smart greenhouse that can be remotely monitored and managed for optimal plant growth and production.</span></p><h1 class="c82 c46 c18" id="h.y9sj3377rzxv"><span class="c59 c25 c81"></span></h1><p class="c23 c18 c10"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c23 c18 c10"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c23 c18 c10"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c23 c18 c10"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c23 c18 c10"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c23 c18 c10"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c23 c18 c10"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c23 c18 c10"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c23 c18 c10"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c23 c18 c10"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c23 c18 c10"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c23 c18 c10"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c23 c18 c10"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c23 c18 c10"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c23 c18 c10"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c23 c18 c10"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c23 c18 c10"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c23 c18 c10"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c23 c18 c10"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c23 c18 c10"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c23 c18 c10"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c23 c18 c10"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c23 c18 c10"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c23 c18 c10"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c23 c18 c10"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c23 c18 c10"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c23 c18 c10"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c23 c18 c10"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c23 c18 c10"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c23 c18 c10"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c23 c18 c10"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c23 c18 c10"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c18 c10 c23"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c23 c18 c10"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c23 c18 c10"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c23 c18 c10"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c23 c18 c10"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c23 c18 c10"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c23 c18 c10"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c23 c18 c10"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c23 c18 c10"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c23 c18 c10"><span class="c12"></span></p><h1 class="c18 c52" id="h.wbfp9k9csja8"><span class="c17">8.

The main focus was on testing the growth of &ldquo;barley, gram, wheatgrass, and green gram under varying environmental conditions&rdquo;. The experiments were conducted in three sets to analyze the impact of &ldquo;temperature, light, and water on plant growth&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c21 c18"><span class="c0">In the initial set of experiments, the impact of &ldquo;temperature and humidity&rdquo; on plant growth was studied. It was found that the hydroponic system could sustain optimal &ldquo;temperature and humidity levels&rdquo;, with a cooling fan that automatically switched on when the temperature exceeded the threshold level and a heating bulb to maintain the optimal temperature when it decreased.</span></p><p class="c21 c18"><span class="c0">The second set of experiments focused on the impact of light on plant growth. Diverse lighting conditions were tested, and it was concluded that shorter lighting periods caused reduced plant growth, whereas increased lighting conditions led to accelerated plant growth. To maintain the appropriate light exposure, the glowing light was set to turn on automatically at scheduled intervals each day.</span></p><p class="c21 c18"><span class="c0">The third experiment aimed to determine the impact of water on plant growth. A moisture sensor was used to monitor the tank&#39;s water level, and an automatic pump activation was triggered once the level went below a specified threshold. The water pump was automatically turned on when the moisture level fell below the threshold to irrigate the plants.</span></p><p class="c21 c18"><span class="c0">The plants&#39; height was monitored twice a day using ultrasonic sensors to observe their growth. Upon reaching a specific height, a notification was displayed on the web dashboard, indicating that the crops were ready to be harvested. The controlled environment in the greenhouse offered favorable conditions for cultivating microgreens sustainably and effectively.</span></p><p class="c40 c18"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 666.97px; height: 376.35px;"><img alt="" src="images/image14.jpg" style="width: 666.97px; height: 376.35px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c27 c18"><span class="c12">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Fig. 18.

It provides an efficient way to grow plants in a controlled environment with no external contaminants, pests, or diseases. In the experiment conducted to investigate optimal conditions for growing microgreens, a hydroponic system was employed to cultivate barley, gram, wheatgrass, and green gram.</span></p><p class="c21 c18"><span class="c0">The controlled environment within the greenhouse offered various advantages to growing plants using a hydroponic system. The greenhouse provided a stable temperature, humidity, and lighting environment, which are crucial factors for plant growth. The hydroponic system allows for greater control over the plants&#39; nutrition, water intake, and exposure to light, making it easier to achieve optimal growth conditions for different types of plants.</span></p><p class="c21 c18"><span class="c0">In the experiment, the hydroponic system incorporated various sensors and automated systems to monitor and adjust the environmental conditions to maintain optimal growing conditions. For example, the cooling fan turned on automatically when the temperature exceeded the threshold level, and the heating bulb maintained the optimal temperature when it decreased. Similarly, the glowing light was set to turn on automatically at scheduled intervals each day to maintain appropriate light exposure.</span></p><p class="c21 c18"><span class="c0">By utilizing the hydroponic system in the controlled environment within the greenhouse, the plants were grown sustainably and effectively. The plants were monitored using ultrasonic sensors, and their height was recorded twice a day to observe their growth. Upon reaching a specific height, a notification was displayed on the web dashboard, indicating that the crops were ready to be harvested. Overall, the use of a hydroponic system in a controlled environment within a greenhouse offers a viable and sustainable option for cultivating plants, including microgreens, under optimal growing conditions.</span></p><p class="c21 c18"><span class="c5">11.3 Testing growth of barley, gram, wheatgrass and green gram under varying environmental conditions</span></p><p class="c21 c18"><span class="c0">The experiment aimed to investigate optimal conditions for growing microgreens by testing the growth of barley, gram, wheatgrass, and green gram under varying environmental conditions.
