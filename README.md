    <h1 class="c16 c32"><span class="c3">I. INTRODUCTION</span></h1>
    <p class="c12"><span class="c1">Food insecurity is a critical issue that affects the global population, with the
            number of people suffering from hunger increasing each year [1]. The problem is compounded by factors such
            as population growth, limited resources, climate change, and limited cultivation lands. In response,
            scientists have been exploring alternative methods to ensure food security, including in-house gardening. In
            recent years, microgreens have gained popularity due to their high nutritional content, ease of cultivation,
            and suitability for indoor growing [2].</span></p>
    <p class="c12"><span class="c1">Monitoring environmental factors, such as temperature, humidity, and light
            intensity, is crucial for indoor microgreen growth as it can affect the quality and growth of the plants. In
            order to overcome this difficulty, the agriculture sector has embraced the application of Internet of Things
            (IoT) technology. This technology enables live monitoring and regulation of the environmental parameters
            within indoor cultivation systems. [3]. The utilization of IoT technology has enabled the improvement of
            crop cultivation in conventional outdoor farming methods by furnishing information regarding weather
            circumstances, soil moisture, and nutrient levels [4]. </span></p>
    <p class="c12"><span class="c1">Studies have indicated that incorporating IoT technology into agriculture can bring
            about notable advantages such as enhancing crop production, minimizing resource consumption, and improving
            overall efficiency. In one study, IoT-based irrigation systems were found to reduce water use by up to 40%
            while maintaining or improving crop yields [5]. Another study found that the use of IoT technology for
            monitoring and control of environmental conditions in a tomato greenhouse led to a 10% increase in yield and
            a 20% reduction in energy use [6]. IoT technology has also been shown to be effective in predicting crop
            diseases, allowing for early detection and intervention to prevent significant crop losses.</span></p>
    <p class="c12"><span class="c1">Indoor microgreen production has gained popularity in recent years due to their
            nutritional benefits and ease of cultivation. However, their growth is sensitive to environmental conditions
            and requires regular monitoring, which can be time-consuming and challenging for home gardeners [7]. In
            order to tackle this problem, scholars have put forward a solution in the form of a smart microgreen
            sprouter based on IoT, which can automate the management of climate parameters and enable remote monitoring
            of microgreens via a web dashboard [8]. This system is housed in a greenhouse structure, which offers an
            ideal environment for optimal growth and can help overcome the challenges of indoor cultivation.</span></p>
    <p class="c12"><span class="c1">The proposed IoT-based system offers several benefits for microgreen cultivation.
            Real-time monitoring of climatic parameters such as temperature, humidity, and light can ensure optimal
            conditions for growth [9]. The system also provides plant protection by monitoring and controlling factors
            that can affect the health of the plants, such as pests and diseases. Improved quality and disease
            prediction can also be achieved through data analysis and machine learning algorithms, which can identify
            patterns and potential issues before they become significant problems [10].</span></p>
    <p class="c12"><span class="c1">Overall, the IoT-based smart microgreen sprouter offers a promising solution for
            indoor microgreen production. With its ability to automate environmental control and provide real-time
            monitoring, this system can help home gardeners and small-scale growers overcome the challenges of indoor
            cultivation and produce high-quality microgreens for personal consumption or commercial use.</span></p>
    <p class="c12"><span class="c1">Indoor vertical farming systems utilizing a greenhouse structure for growing
            microgreens have gained popularity as a solution to food insecurity caused by limited resources, limited
            cultivation lands, and climate change [11]. The proposed system offers several benefits, including improved
            quality, plant protection, disease prediction, and real-time monitoring. Additionally, for maintaining good
            health, the World Health Organization suggests consuming 400 grams of fruits and vegetables on a daily
            basis. However, the current consumption of fruits and vegetables is much lower, at 209.89 grams per capita,
            primarily due to high prices caused by uneven distribution and high land rent in urban areas [12].</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c12"><span class="c1">Microgreens are young vegetable greens rich in minerals and vitamins, offering
            numerous health benefits such as reducing heart attack risks, controlling diabetes, and improving the immune
            system [13]. Brassicaceae, Apiaceae, Asteraceae, Amaranthaceae, Amaryllidaceae, and Cucurbitaceae are among
            the most common microgreen varieties [14]. To ensure healthy microgreen growth, optimal environmental
            conditions, moist soil, and appropriate sunshine are necessary. Mung beans grow rapidly and thrive in
            temperatures ranging from 28&deg;C to 30&deg;C, while also requiring well-drained loamy or sandy soil that
            has a pH level between 5 and 8 [15].</span></p>
    <p class="c12"><span class="c1">The primary objective of implementing IoT technology in agriculture is to enhance
            productivity and efficiency [16]. The system for indoor vertical farming of microgreens that is based on the
            Internet of Things (IoT) technology involves the use of intelligent microgreen sprouters located in a
            greenhouse-like structure. This set-up allows for the automation of climate control parameters and remote
            monitoring of the microgreens via a web dashboard. [17]. Such systems have shown promising results in the
            efficient and sustainable production of fresh produce while minimizing environmental impact [18].</span></p>
    <p class="c12 c22"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c20"><span class="c3">II</span><span class="c3">. BACKGROUND STUDY</span></p>
    <p class="c12"><span class="c7">Nutritional Content Of Microgreens: </span><span>Microgreens come in a variety of
        </span><span>flavours</span><span>, textures, and </span><span>colours</span><span>&nbsp;and can add a unique
        </span><span>flavour</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and texture to any dish. Wheatgrass microgreens are a good
            source of chlorophyll that has powerful detoxifying and antioxidant properties. Green gram microgreens are
            high in enzymes, vitamins, minerals, and fiber, and may help to improve digestion. Barley microgreens are
            rich in fiber, antioxidants, vitamin C, iron, and zinc and have anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, and
            anti-diabetic properties. Microgreens from chickpeas are a nutritious food choice as they provide protein,
            dietary fiber, minerals, and vitamins. They possess antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that could
            assist in regulating blood sugar levels. These studies demonstrate the potential health benefits of
            incorporating microgreens into one&#39;s diet. [19]</span></p>
    <p class="c12"><span class="c7">Microgreen Growing Process: </span><span class="c1">Microgreens are grown by
            planting seeds in a growing medium and harvesting them at the microgreen stage for consumption. Hydroponic
            techniques can improve the yield and quality of microgreens compared to traditional soil-based growing
            methods. [20] Various substrates can be used for growing microgreens, each with its own advantages and
            disadvantages. [21] Environmental factors such as light intensity and duration, temperature, and humidity
            are important for the optimal growth and development of microgreens. [22] Microgreens are generally more
            nutritious than mature plants, containing high amounts of vitamins, antioxidants, and other phytochemicals.
            Automation and IoT technologies are increasingly being used in microgreen production for efficiency and cost
            reduction. [23]</span></p>
    <p class="c12"><span class="c7">Hydroponic Method Vs Soil Based</span><span class="c11">: </span><span
            class="c1">There have been several studies comparing the soil-based and hydroponic methods of growing
            microgreens. Here are some key facts and figures:</span></p>
    <p class="c12"><span class="c7">Faster growth:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Hydroponic systems can lead to faster
            growth rates in microgreens than soil-based systems. According to a study by Babalola et al. (2019), the
            growth rate of microgreens in hydroponic systems was significantly faster than in soil-based systems, with
            hydroponic microgreens reaching full maturity in 7 days, compared to 14 days for soil-based microgreens.[24]
        </span></p>
    <p class="c12"><span class="c7">Increased nutrient content:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Hydroponic systems allow
            for more precise control of nutrient delivery to the plants, which can result in increased nutrient content
            in the microgreens. A study by Xiao et al. (2016) found that hydroponic systems produced microgreens with
            higher levels of phenolic compounds, flavonoids, and antioxidants compared to soil-based systems.[25]
        </span></p>
    <p class="c12"><span class="c7">Higher yields:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Hydroponic systems can also lead to
            higher yields of microgreens compared to soil-based systems. A study by Babalola et al. (2019) found that
            hydroponic systems produced significantly higher yields of microgreens compared to soil-based
            systems.[26]</span></p>
    <p class="c12"><span class="c7">Lower water usage</span><span class="c1">: Hydroponic systems can be more
            water-efficient than soil-based systems. A study by Dong et al. (2020) found that hydroponic systems used
            significantly less water compared to soil-based systems for growing microgreens.[32]</span></p>
    <p class="c12"><span class="c7">Lower microbial contamination</span><span class="c1">: Hydroponic systems can also
            have lower levels of microbial contamination compared to soil-based systems. A study by Xiao et al. (2016)
            found that hydroponic systems produced microgreens with lower levels of microbial contamination compared to
            soil-based systems.[27]</span></p>
    <p class="c12"><span class="c7">Most Commonly Harvested Microgreens :</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;</span><span
            class="c1">Wheatgrass: Harvested in 7-14 days with hydroponic or soil-based methods, rich in chlorophyll and
            has health benefits. [28] Green Gram: Harvested in 4-7 days with hydroponic or soil-based methods, rich in
            antioxidants and has health benefits. [29] Barley: Harvested in 7-14 days with hydroponic or soil-based
            methods, rich in vitamins and minerals and has health benefits. [30] Gram: Harvested in 5-10 days with
            hydroponic or soil-based methods, rich in antioxidants and has health benefits. [31] </span></p>
    <p class="c12"><span class="c1">Microgreens from these crops are easy to grow, provide health benefits, and can be
            grown using various methods, suitable for home gardeners and commercial growers.</span></p>
    <p class="c12"><span class="c7">Easiest Microgreens To Grow</span><span class="c11">: </span><span
            class="c1">Hydroponic method is an effective way to grow nutrient-rich microgreens [32]. The easiest
            microgreens to grow hydroponically are broccoli, radish, arugula, and amaranth. Six different microgreens
            grown hydroponically have high nutrient content [33]. Hydroponic cultivation of microgreens has numerous
            benefits over traditional soil-based methods. Broccoli, radish, arugula, and amaranth are the easiest to
            grow hydroponically, but other microgreens can also be cultivated using this method [34].</span></p>
    <p class="c12"><span class="c7">Biostrate</span><span class="c11">: </span><span class="c1">Biostrate is a
            biodegradable non-woven fabric used for plant growth, particularly microgreens due to its moisture retention
            and stability. [35] Biostrate results in higher yield and growth of microgreens compared to other
            substrates. [36] Microgreens grown on biostrate have higher levels of antioxidants and nutrients. [37]
            Biostrate reduces bacterial contamination in microgreens compared to soil-based cultivation. [38] Arugula,
            kale, and radish can be grown on biostrate with good yield and quality. [39]</span></p>
    <p class="c20"><span class="c3">&nbsp;III. Proposed Methodology</span></p>
    <p class="c12"><span class="c1">This research created a smart system to monitor and control agriculture in a closed
            environment that doesn&#39;t get natural sunlight, like a farming box. The system uses sensors, controls, a
            microcontroller, and a wi-fi module to connect to a cloud-based information system. The microcontroller
            sends data to the cloud-based system where it is stored in a database. The data can then be viewed on a
            website for further analysis. This technology helps farmers manage their crops more efficiently. </span></p>
    <p class="c12"><span class="c1">In simpler terms, the system automatically collects data and makes adjustments based
            on that data to control the environment for planting. The data collected is primarily for research or future
            system improvements, but it may also be used to make manual adjustments if needed. The control variables are
            adjusted automatically using programmed logic in microcontrollers.</span></p>

    <p class="c20"><span class="c1">Fig. 1. Data Flow Diagram </span></p>
    <p class="c12"><span>The box will be designed to reduce the amount of light that enters it, creating a dark and
            enclosed environment. Instead of relying on sunlight, a grow light will be installed at the top to provide
            the main source of light. To regulate the humidity and airflow, a fan will be installed on the side of the
            box, which can be adjusted as needed. The bottom of the box will hold water, and a water pump will be used
            to manage the amount of water in the growing media. Plants will be placed in a tray with planting media and
            put inside the box. Additionally, sensors will be installed to monitor and control the humidity,
            temperature, and moisture levels in the system, which will be connected to the different actuators.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c12"><span class="c1">The development of hardware includes the development of:</span></p>
    <p class="c12"><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c11">A.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c11">Microcontroller
            Box</span><span>:</span><span class="c13">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">We will make a box that will house
            an IoT system comprising a microcontroller, a Wi-Fi module, various sensors, actuators, and other necessary
            electronic components. This box will be designed to keep all these components organized and secure.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c12"><span class="c1">To begin, the procedure involves placing small beans in a tray and then putting the
            tray inside a container containing a sensor that detects soil moisture. The sensor is used to determine if
            the soil is sufficiently damp to support the growth of mung beans. If the soil is too dry, a motor will turn
            on and spray water on the plants. Once the soil is moist enough, the motor will turn off. A microcontroller
            is a small computer that will serve as the &quot;brain&quot; of the IoT system, controlling and monitoring
            the different sensors.</span></p>
    <p class="c12"><span class="c1">The growth of plants and water level in the tank are measured twice daily using a
            pair of sensors, with the collected data displayed on a dashboard. Additionally, the temperature and
            humidity inside the container are monitored five times a day using a DHT-11 sensor. In the event of high
            temperatures, the system automatically activates a fan to cool down the environment while simultaneously
            turning off the light. If the temperature decreases, the fan&#39;s speed will change and the light will also
            adjust. &nbsp;The same sensor measures the humidity and the fan can be used to control it. Every 4 to 5
            hours, the light will turn on to provide proper light for the plants.</span></p>
    <p class="c12"><span class="c1">The ultrasonic sensor measures plant growth every 12 hours. Fuzzy logic utilizes a
            set of rules to manage the temperature and watering system. Figure 1 is the flow diagram of our IoT
            design.</span></p>

    <p class="c19"><span class="c11">B. Microgreen-Devices : </span><span class="c1">The idea is to grow microgreens in
            trays with a system that keeps the growing media consistently moist for optimal germination. The software
            development will be split into two parts: simplifying the language used and making it applicable to a local
            audience. </span></p>
    <p class="c12"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Making automation programs on the microcontroller. &nbsp;During the system
            design phase, the information model generated in the analysis phase is transformed into a model that is
            compatible with the technology used to implement the system. In the context of IoT applications, the
            architecture of the system can be divided into three layers - the sensor layer, transport layer, and
            application layer. This three-layered structure is especially suitable for surveillance and control systems,
            and the system architecture is developed based on this model. Essentially, the approach involves breaking
            down the system into distinct layers that collaborate to achieve the intended functionality. </span></p>
    <p class="c12"><span class="c1">This is a system that can be used to monitor the growth of microgreens in an indoor
            vertical farm. It is automated and can operate without any manual input. The system is equipped with sensors
            that can measure soil moisture and light levels, which are important factors for microgreen growth. These
            sensors are connected to a database which records the data in real time. This makes it easy to track the
            progress of microgreen production and identify areas where improvements can be made to increase production.
            The system is capable of functioning in areas that are distant and where the manual monitoring of soil
            moisture and light is not a viable option. The data recorded in the database can be used to make informed
            decisions about how to optimize production and increase yields. This information can also be useful for
            entrepreneurs who are looking to invest in indoor smart farming for microgreens. </span></p>

    <p class="c19"><span class="c1">The mobile app interface allows users to monitor plant conditions and manage
            critical parameters like light, temperature, and watering schedules. The intuitive design displays plant
            growth data, tracks progress, and detects issues. Custom alerts and notifications allow for prompt
            intervention. This interface design is essential for optimal microgreens growth in a controlled
            environment.[*]</span></p>

    <p class="c19"><span class="c17 c3 c15">IV. Result and Discussion</span></p>
    <p class="c12"><span class="c1">To investigate the optimal conditions for growing microgreens, a hydroponic system
            was employed to cultivate barley, gram, wheatgrass, and green gram in a controlled environment within a
            greenhouse. Experiments were conducted to test the growth of the plants under varying environmental
            conditions. The initial experiments aimed to study the impact of temperature and humidity on the growth of
            plants. The greenhouse was tested for varying temperature levels and it was found that the system could
            sustain the optimal temperature and humidity levels. The system incorporated a cooling fan that
            automatically switched on when the temperature exceeded the threshold level and a heating bulb to maintain
            the optimal temperature when it decreased. To investigate the impact of light on plant growth, the second
            set of experiments was conducted, where diverse lighting conditions were tested. It was concluded that
            shorter lighting periods caused reduced plant growth, whereas increased lighting conditions led to
            accelerated plant growth. To maintain the appropriate light exposure, the glowing light was set to turn on
            automatically at scheduled intervals each day. To determine the impact of water on plant growth, a third
            experiment was conducted. The tank&#39;s water level was monitored using a moisture sensor, triggering an
            automatic pump activation once the level went below a specified threshold. To irrigate the plants, the water
            pump was automatically turned on when the moisture level fell below the threshold. The plants were monitored
            using ultrasonic sensors, and their height was recorded twice a day to observe their growth. </span></p>
    <p class="c12"><span class="c1">Upon reaching a specific height, a notification was displayed on the web dashboard,
            indicating that the crops were ready to be harvested. The greenhouse&#39;s controlled environment offered
            favourable conditions for cultivating microgreens. By utilizing the hydroponic system in the greenhouse, the
            plants were grown sustainably and effectively.</span></p>

    <p class="c19"><span class="c1">In conclusion, the hydroponic microgreen growing system in a greenhouse can be
            optimised using various environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, light, and water. By varying
            these parameters, we were able to adjust the growing conditions to maintain the optimal growth of different
            microgreens. The mobile application provided an easy way for users to monitor and control the growing
            conditions remotely. The use of ultrasonic sensors allowed for real-time monitoring of plant growth and
            timely harvesting. Overall, this system shows promising results for efficient and controlled microgreen
            cultivation, which can have potential applications in the food industry and agriculture. Further studies
            could focus on optimizing the system for specific microgreens and improving the automation process for more
            efficient and consistent growth.</span></p>
